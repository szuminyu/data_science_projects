### HINTS 5 Cycle 3 (2019)

Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS) is conducted by National Cancer Institute. This survey collects American public uses' of cancer information, including questions related to the source of health or medical information, whether respondent has cancer, etc. 
I analyze this dataset as part of the market research for the client that my company is working with. They are a prominent cancer research institution in New York. 

The goal of this notebook is to explore features that could play important roles in predicting cancer patient have cancer, whether they look for cancer information, and to segment cancer patients into different groups.

In this notebook, I apply Logistic Regession and Random Forest Classifiers to classify patients. I also use SHAP value to interpret the model.
Besides, I segment using K-Means Clustering to extract more information about the differences between groups.
